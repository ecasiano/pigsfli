# Documentation  

## Introduction 

This webpage contains the details of a ground state (i.e, zero-temperature) lattice worm algorithm path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (WA-PIMC) code actively developed in c++ since 2020 based on:

- [N.V. Prokof'ev, B.V. Svistunov, I.S. Tupitsyn: Exact, Complete, and Universal Continuous-Time Worldline Monte Carlo Approach to the Statistics of Discrete Quantum Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9703200)
- [N. Prokof'ev Lattice Path-Integral Monte Carlo Lecture Notes](http://mcwa.csi.cuny.edu/umass/lectures/part5.pdf)

In its current version, it can be used to simulate indistinguishable bosons in the one,two, and three-dimensional hypercubic Bose-Hubbard Model. As written, it takes a large number of command line options and allows for the measurement of the system energy and the RÃ©nyi Entanglement Entropy between spatial bipartitions of the lattice.

If you have questions on code usage or bug reports, please contact me at ecasiano@vols.utk.edu.

The development and maintenance of this code base has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Award No. [DMR-2041995](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2041995&HistoricalAwards=false) and Award No. [DMR-1553991](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1553991)

## Installation

This program has been successfully compiled and runs on Intel systems using clang and g++. Before installing, one needs to ensure that all dependencies are met.  We recommend that the required libraries (boost) are installed in a `local` folder inside your home directory: `$HOME/local`.

To clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DelMaestroGroup/pigsfli.git
```
## Dependencies 

The code is written in c++ and makes use of <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> libraries and, for handling of command-line arguments, the <a href="https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts">cxxopts</a> header-only library. For generation of random numbers and the ability to save the state of an RNG for simulation restarts, we use <a href="https://github.com/ajibadeshd/RNG_CLASS">RNG_CLASS</a>. Both cxxopts and RNG_CLASS are included in the repository when cloning.

## Compilation

After dependencies are satisfied, you are now ready to compile the
main pigsfli program on your system.
pigsfli uses CMake for build, test and installation automation. For details on using CMake consult https://cmake.org/documentation/. In short, the following steps should work on UNIX-like systems:

```
cd pigsfli
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
make
sudo make install
  ```

The following are some CMake options that can be edited in before compilation, where xxx should be replaced with the appropriate values:

- `-D NDIM=1|2|3` the number of spatial dimensions
- `-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=xxx` equal to the name of the C99 Compiler you wish to use (or the environment variable `CC`)
- `-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=xxx` equal to the name of the C++17 compiler you wish to use (or the environment variable `CXX`)
- `-D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=xxx` to add a non-standard location for CMake to search for libraries, headers or programs
- `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=xxx` to install pigsfli to a non-standard location
- `-D BOOST_ROOT=xxx` to add non-standard location for Boost install
- `-D STATIC=1` to enable a static build
- `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to build pigsfli in debug mode
- `-E env CXXFLAGS="xxx"` add additional compiler flags
- `-E env LDFLAGS="xxx"` add additional linker flags

Executables will be installed to the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` location or if the install step is skipped, they will be located in `build/pigsfli`.
The executable produced will be `pigsfli.e`. Or `pigsflid.e` for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release|Debug`.

If you run into problems, failures with linking etc., common errors may include
not properly setting your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or not starting from a clean build
directory (issue `make clean` or `rm -rf ./*` inside the build directory).

## Usage

In order to get a quick idea of the options which the code accepts type:
```bash
pigsfli.e --help
```

### Quick Start 

If you want to perform a quick test-run for a small one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattice you could try something like:

```

All options, including lists of possible values and default values can be seen
by using the `--help flag`.

### Output explanation

In Stage (1/3), histograms of the total particle number distribution are shown, where each of the asterisks (*) represents a normalized count. For canonical ensemble simulations, like the one shown above, the only particle numbers visited are $N-1$, $N$, and $N+1$, where $N$ is the target number of particles. A grand canonical simulation will show histograms with more particle numbers than these. Once the peak of the distribution is at $N$, and it's at least 33% larger than the next largest sector, we proceed to the "fine tuning eta" stage. Here, eta is either shrunk or augmented until we reach the desired percentage of configurations with no worms present (currently, we set this window between 40 and 45%).

Stage (2/3), the code is ran without taking any measurement as a en equilibration step. The number of equilibration steps are currently determined by the sweeps parameter from the command line.

Finally, Stage (3/3) is where measurements are performed and samples collected. Once the desired number of samples are collected, the simulation stops. Near the bottom of the terminal output above, the number of times that each of the updates is accepted and proposed are shown as a fraction. The number of times that the update is accepted is shown in the numerator, whereas the times that it was proposed is shown in the denominator.

The total run time of equilibration and Main Monte Carlo loops is shown at the bottom of the output, in seconds.

After this has been completed, you can analyze the results of your run using the scripts in the https://github.com/DelMaestroGroup/papers-code-pigsfli.
